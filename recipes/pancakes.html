        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I found this pancake recipe in my Grandma's recipe book. 
            Judging from the weathered look of this recipe card, 
            this was a family favorite.
        </p>
        <p>Perfect pancakes are easier to make than you think. 
            This pancake recipe produces thick, fluffy, and all-around 
            delicious pancakes with just a few ingredients that are 
            probably already in your kitchen (and it's so much better 
            than the boxed stuff).
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups milk</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Sift flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together 
                in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and add 
                milk, melted butter, and egg; mix until smooth.
            </li>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high 
                heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, 
                using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake; cook 
                until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 
                to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the 
                other side. Repeat with remaining batter.
            </li>
        </ol>
